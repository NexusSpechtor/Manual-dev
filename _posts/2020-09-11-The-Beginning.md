I was hired as a medical assistant in Germantown, but that lasted only two weeks. 
First, I was pulled to another office. Then they asked me to go to yet another office & become a nurse assistant.
For the next three years I continued to work as a nurse assistant with three amazing nurses.

When the practice transitioned to an EMR, I kept asking for an SOP.
Little did I know that I was going to be the one to write it.
